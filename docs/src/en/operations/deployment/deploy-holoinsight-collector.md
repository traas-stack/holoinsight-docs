# Deploy HoloInsight collector
The HoloInsight collector is a component developed based on the [OpenTelemetry collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector), which is used to receive, process, and export telemetry data in a vendor-neutral manner and perform authentication. 

Now the HoloInsight collector can be [quickly deployed](../../introduction/quick-start.md) based on docker-compose or k8s within server-side demo.
