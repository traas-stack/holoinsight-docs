# HoloInsight Application Monitoring
HoloInsight application monitoring is a concept very similar to [APM](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/application-performance-monitoring-apm), which is designed to help you observe your software performance and related infrastructure, user experience, and business impact from an application perspective.

You can enable HoloInsight Application Monitoring in the following 2 stepsï¼š
1. [Deploy the HoloInsight collector](../../operations/deployment/deploy-holoinsight-collector.md).
2. [Send traces to HoloInsight](send-traces-to-holoinsight.md).

Then, you can observe your application data on the HoloInsight dashboard:
1. [Service topology](service-topology.md).
2. [APM metric data](apm-metric-data.md).
3. [Distributed tracing](distributed-tracing.md).
4. [Downstream components](downstream-components.md).
